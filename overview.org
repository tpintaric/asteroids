* Asteroids Game
- Project course for OOP lessons we took.
- Will utilize bootdev cli utilities.
** uv package manager
- An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.
- Install in arch using:  pacman -S uv
** Pygame & Virtual Envrionment
- Pygame is a module for developing games using Python. It provides simple functions and methods for us to easily draw images within a GUI window and handle user input.
- Virtual environments are Python's way to keep dependencies (e.g. the pygame module) separate from other projects on our machine. For example, we need pygame version 2 for this project, but another project on your computer might require version 1.

- As a best practice, each Python project on your machine should have
   its own virtual environment to keep them isolated from each other.
